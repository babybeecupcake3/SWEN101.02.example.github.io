        <h1> hi i'm bee, your great and powerful dark overlord bow to me </h1>
        <p> I'm Bianca, and I'm a student at SWEN 101 this year (obviously). I went to high school in Northern 
            Virginia, where I've been studying Japanese for at least six years at this point (it's a secondary school
            with feral middle schoolers). My favorite thing to do is play video games, but I also really like making art. </p>
